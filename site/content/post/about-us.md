description: Jeric is originally from the Philippines, where, he says,
  “Filipinos really love to eat peanut butter!” They usually have it on bread
  for breakfast. When Jeric and his family arrived in New Zealand in 2017, they
  couldn't find Filipino-style peanut butter in shops, so they had to get it
  from a fellow Filipino who was making a homemade version. When that seller
  stopped making it, Jeric decided to make his own! He started by selling it to
  friends, and it’s now available in half a dozen Asian shops and bakeries
  across Christchurch. Jeric also sells the sweet, Filipino-style peanut butter
  on Facebook, @kabayanspeanutbutter
